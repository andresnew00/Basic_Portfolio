    <p>Hi! My name is Andres Inciarte, I am a student at Georgia Tech, I try to always learn new things and
        as much as I can, I like setting goals, and figting hard to accomplish them in the least ammont possible.<p>
    <p>As a kid I always grew up around video games, and programs on my pc, these always intriged me and now I have the chance of learning more about
        this topic, and I will do my best.<p>
    <p>I love animals, in fact I used to be a Veterinarian Assistant for two and a half years, which I loved but took a break from to focus more on my career and 
        expand my future opportunities. </p>
