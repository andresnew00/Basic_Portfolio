      <p>Hi! My name is Andres Inciarte, I am a student at Georgia Tech, I try to always learn new things and as much
        as I
        can, I like setting goals, and figting hard to accomplish them in the least ammont possible.
        <p>
            <p>As a kid I always grew up around video games, and programs on my pc, these always intriged me and
                now I have
                the chance of learning more about this topic, and I will do my best.
                <p>
                    <p>I love animals, in fact I used to be a Veterinarian Assistant for two and a half years,
                        which I loved
                        but took a break from to focus more on my career and expand my future opportunities. </p>
